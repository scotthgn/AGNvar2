# AGNvar2

Full Spectral Timing Model for AGN, written in Python, and used in Hagen, Done & Edelson (Submitted).
The model has the ability to calculate fully time-dependent AGN SEDs, including intrinsic variability (propagating fluctuations), disc reverberation, and wind re-processing


Documentation will be coming soon (once I have time to sit down and write it!)
Until then, if you have questions, email me at scott.hagen@durham.ac.uk
