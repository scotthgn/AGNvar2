# AGNvar2

Full Spectral Timing Model for AGN, written in Python, and described in Hagen, Done & Edelson (Submitted): https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240103452H/abstract.

The model has the ability to calculate fully time-dependent AGN SEDs, including intrinsic variability (propagating fluctuations), disc reverberation, and wind re-processing
It considers the case where the variability is generated by mass-accretion rate fluctuations within the accretion flow itself. In this picture slow variability is
generated in the disc (or outer regions), which then propagates down into the X-ray corona where the fast variability is produced. The slow the modulates the fast.
As well as these intrinsic processes, the code includes the effect of X-ray radiation incident on the disc giving a rapid re-processed component to the disc variability
(conserving energy throughout such that the response is accurate), and it includes the possibility of calculating the re-processed signal from a wind component, using 
Cloudy photoionisation claculations (it is recomended to use a computer with a large amount of memory for these calculations...).
Overall the effect is a model that can describe and calculate complex variability signatures in AGN.

Note that the current release has been tailored for moderate Eddington ratio AGN, where there is likely to be a disc present.
Current work is extending to low Eddington ratio systems where the structure of the flow could be vastly different.


Documentation will be coming soon (once I have time to sit down and write it!)
